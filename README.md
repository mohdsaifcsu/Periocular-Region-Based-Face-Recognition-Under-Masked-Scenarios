# Periocular Region-Based Face Recognition Under Masked Scenarios

## Master’s Thesis - Liverpool John Moores University (2023–2024)


## Overview

This thesis explores periocular (eye-region) recognition for masked or occluded face scenarios. I designed hybrid biometric approaches by combining texture- and shape-based descriptors to improve robustness when the lower face is unavailable.

### Key Contributions

- Implemented hybrid periocular recognition using SING, HOG, and KAZE descriptors
- Built a modular Python pipeline for preprocessing, feature extraction, and matching
- Evaluated across CASIA-Iris, AR, and UBIPr datasets
- Achieved improved accuracy compared to single-descriptor baselines
